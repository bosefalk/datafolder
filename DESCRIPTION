Description: This R package is intended as a light-weight solution to the following problem: You can sync code to a git remote, but do not want to sync the actual data. It creates a list of the contents of a data subfolder, writes this to a csv file which can be synced to git remotes, with functions to check for mismatches between this .csv and the local data folder contents. 
Depends:
  dplyr, 
  rlang,
